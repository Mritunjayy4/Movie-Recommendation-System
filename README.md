# Movie Recommendation System

## Author: Mrituinjay Shahi

## Project Overview

Welcome to **Movie Match**, your personalized movie recommendation system! Powered by the Close Match algorithm, Movie Match offers highly accurate movie suggestions based on your preferences.

## Dataset

For this project, I utilized the dataset from the YBI Foundation Kaggle repository. You can access the dataset [here](https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Customer%20Purchase.csv). This dataset contains comprehensive information about movies, user ratings, and other relevant features necessary for building our recommendation system.

How It Works

- Close Match Algorithm: Movie Match uses the Close Match algorithm to identify approximate string matches, accommodating minor input variations such as typos or incomplete titles.
- Personalized Recommendations: Input your favorite movie, and Movie Match will provide you with a curated list of movie recommendations tailored just for you.
